DUMMY/LJ018-0165.wav|on a certain day , the twenty-seventh october , eighteen sixty-two , the two were arrested simultaneously ;

DUMMY/LJ039-0206.wav|each series of three shots landed within areas ranging in diameter from three to five inches .
DUMMY/LJ018-0298.wav|time was clearly an important factor in the fraud , hence the bills were sent forward in quick succession .
DUMMY/LJ008-0011.wav|this was partly due to the survival of the old notion that the scene of the crime ought also to witness the retribution ;
DUMMY/LJ039-0201.wav|fired two series of three shots at twenty-five yards in four point six and four point eight seconds .
DUMMY/LJ018-0250.wav|but at the same time with an air of the most entire truthfulness and candor .
DUMMY/LJ044-0035.wav|this is suggested by his misleading and sometime untruthful statements in his letters to mister v. t. lee ,
DUMMY/LJ047-0013.wav|finally , the commission has reviewed the complete files on oswald , as they existed at the time of the assassination , of the department of state ,

DUMMY/LJ024-0081.wav|but we can not yield our constitutional destiny to the personal judgment of a few men who , being fearful of the future ,
DUMMY/LJ012-0284.wav|it was not until he left the bus , and walked up by the regent 's canal , that he conceived the idea of throwing the head into the water .
DUMMY/LJ008-0191.wav|at courvoisier 's execution in eighteen forty it was the same , or worse .
DUMMY/LJ031-0174.wav|after the president was pronounced dead ,
DUMMY/LJ048-0110.wav|since the president was to be at the trade mart longer than at any other location in dallas and in view of the security hazards presented by the building ,
DUMMY/LJ034-0020.wav|the cartons were forwarded to the fbi in washington .

DUMMY/LJ050-0202.wav|lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions

DUMMY/LJ019-0379.wav|matters went on after the eighteen sixty-five act much the same as they had done before . districts differed greatly in the attention they paid to prison affairs .

DUMMY/LJ043-0175.wav|the items which oswald left at home when he made his attack on walker suggest a strong concern for his place in history .

DUMMY/LJ043-0090.wav|even though oswald indicated that he liked photographic work , his employer found that he was not an efficient worker .
DUMMY/LJ037-0160.wav|he explained that the bullets were slightly smaller than the barrel of the pistol which had fired them . this caused the bullets to have an erratic passage through the barrel
